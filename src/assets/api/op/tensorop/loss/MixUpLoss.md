## MixUpLoss
```python
MixUpLoss(loss, lam=None, y_true=None, y_pred=None, inputs=None, outputs=None, mode=None)
```
This class should be used in conjunction with MixUpBatch to perform mix-up training, which helps to reduceover-fitting, stabilize GAN training, and harden against adversarial attacks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412)

#### Args:

* **loss (func)** :  A loss object (tf.losses) which can be invoked like "loss(true, pred)". It's reduction method    will be overridden to 'none'
* **lam** :  The key of the lambda value generated by MixUpBatch
* **y_true** :  ground truth label key
* **y_pred** :  prediction label key
* **inputs** :  A tuple or list like [<lam>, <y_true>, <y_pred>]
* **outputs** :  Where to store the computed loss value (not required under normal use cases)
* **mode** :  'train', 'eval', 'test', or None
